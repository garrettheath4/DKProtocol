DKProtocol
By: Lee Davis and Garrett Koller
Project 1 of CS 321 with Dr. Stough

The original goal of the project was to implement a simple transport layer
protocol that would implement some basic features of TCP such as checksums,
sliding window protocol, and security. To implement a transport layer protocol,
it is necessary to use raw sockets, which use IP packets to connect and send
information between different nodes. Raw sockets, however, require root access
which was not known to the authors of DKP at the time. As a result, TCP sockets
are used to make connections, and within the data field of a TCP packet is a
checksum and sliding window information relevant to DKP.   Therefore, DKP acts
more as a Session or Presentation layer protocol built that uses TCP rather than
a transport layer.  Further, DKP does not provide any security features.
